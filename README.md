# No-Show Appointments
## This is my first project in 'advanced data analysis' Nanodegree program

In this project I investigated a dataset of No-show appoinments records for Brasil public hospitals. This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.
